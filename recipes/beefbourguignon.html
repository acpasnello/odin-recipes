    <p>A classic French dish.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1.5 to 2kg low cuts of Beef: Shin and Chuck</li>
        <li>1 bottle of wine, 75cl. Ideally something robust.</li>
        <li>1.5 liter of organic beef broth / beef stock</li>
        <li>2 medium sized carrots.</li>
        <li>2 medium sized onions</li>
        <li>400 g thick-cut bacon cut into small pieces</li>
        <li>400 g button mushrooms. Smaller are more suited.</li>
        <li>20-30 pearl onions (about 300g)</li>
        <li>2 tsp sugar</li>
        <li>Seasoning to taste.</li>
        <li>1 tbsp AP flour or 1 tbsp cornstarch, diluted in half a glass of cold water.
        (if you want it creamier and a little thicker you can use 2 tbsp)</li>
        <li>Tomato puree : 2 tsp.</li>
        <li>Bunch of herbs:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>4 sprigs of Thyme</li>
            <li>2-3 Bay leaves</li>
            <li>1 Green part of leek</li>
            <li>1 Celery stalk</li>
        </ul>
        <li>5 garlic cloves</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <h4>Marination</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut meat into 2-3 inch pieces. They shrink a bit during cooking.</li>
        <li>Add onions, carrots and the meat to a big container.</li>
        <li>Drop the wine. All of it. Keep a glass for yourself, you deserve it.</li>
        <li>Let this marinate in the fridge for 1 hour. I did it at room temperature because my studio is pretty cold.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>The Stew</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Strain the meat, pat it dry, Season with kosher salt</li>
        <li>Sear the meat in oil until nicely coloured on both sides.</li>
        <li>Discard the oil.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle with a heaped tbsp of flour. Thickener.</li>
        <li>Cook for a minute, stirring. Then drop the wine and the stock.</li>
        <li>2 tsp of tomato purée for umami and colour.</li>
        <li>Flambé safely: Don’t put your head over it, don’t do it under the kitchen hood, keep your distances.</li>
        <li>Bring to a boil, skim the scum regularly.</li>
        <li>Two cooking options:</li>
        <ol>
            <li>The Oven: 2 hours at 200°C or 400°F then a little check, then again 2 hours at 200°C</li>
            <li>The Stove: Low heat, 4 hours the first three with a lid.</li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
            <li>In both cases, the meat should be super soft and tender. If not, keep cooking.</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
    <h4>Garnishes</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook all three garnishes during the last hour of the stew.</li>
        <li>Place all peeled pearl onions in a pan.</li>
        <li>Add a knob of butter, 2 tsp sugar , water till they are halfway covered</li>
        <li>Top with a lid or with a piece of parchment paper, with a hole in the center.</li>
        <li>About 10-15 minutes will cook and caramelise them.</li>
        <li>When the water is gone, they should be ready (prick with a knife to see if it’s soft). If not, add water and continue. If yes, Set aside</li>
        <li>Cut bacon into sticks ; 1inch long1/4inch wide (lardons), Fry them on medium heat until caramelisation appears.</li>
        <li>Remove fat (keep for cooking your next omelet). Set aside.</li>
        <li>Cut mushrooms into quarters, halves or leave whole if they are small.</li>
        <li>Place them in a pan covered with a bit of beef stock. 5 minutes is all they need.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Finish</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Add ¾ of the garnishes to the stew, one piece of dark chocolate and cook together for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Top plates with a little more garnishes and some fresh thyme.</li>
        <li>Sauce should be glossy. If not you can always drop in a few knobs of cold butter off the heat, and swirl around until melted.</li>
    </ol>
